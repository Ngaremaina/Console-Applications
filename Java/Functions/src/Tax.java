/*Write a program using the tax information below: -
Gross Pay                  	      Tax Rate
Over 50,000			35%
>= 40,000 but below 50,000	30%
>=20,000 but below 40,000	25%
>=12,000 but below 20,000	15%
Below 12,000			no tax.
Write a program that accepts the gross pay and outputs both the tax amount and the
net pay (Assume the net pay is gross pay â€“ tax amount).
Define a function calc_tax that accepts the gross from main and then computes and returns the tax amount.
Main should then output both the tax amount and the net pay.
